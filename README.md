## About

`react-native-reanimated-graph` is a React Native component that provides a customizable and animated graph for displaying data. It allows you to visualize data points on a graph and supports various configuration options to customize the appearance and behavior of the graph. It is used in the [Birdwingo mobile app](https://www.birdwingo.com) to show user portfolio graphs and market graphs.

## Installation

```bash
npm install react-native-svg
npm install react-native-reanimated
npm install react-native-gesture-handler
npm install @birdwingo/react-native-reanimated-graph
```

## Usage

To use the `ReanimatedGraph` component, you need to import it in your React Native application and include it in your JSX code. Here's an example of how to use it:

```jsx
import React, { useRef } from 'react';
import { View } from 'react-native';
import ReanimatedGraph, { ReanimatedGraphPublicMethods } from '@birdwingo/react-native-reanimated-graph';

const data = {
  // Your data points here
  xAxis: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
  yAxis: [0, 5, 2, 7, 4],
};

const YourComponent = () => {
  const graphRef = useRef<ReanimatedGraphPublicMethods>(null);

  const updateGraphData = () => {
    // Call this function to update the data displayed on the graph
    if (graphRef.current) {
      graphRef.current.updateData(data);
    }
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <ReanimatedGraph
        ref={graphRef}
        xAxis={data.xAxis}
        yAxis={data.yAxis}
        // Add any other props as needed
      />
    </View>
  );
};

export default YourComponent;
```
